Sync for Zanto
--------------

Still in heavy development, so not everything will work and stuff can and will change. More documentation will follow when a more stable version is ahead.

This plugin is written for WordPress 3.8.x and Zanto 0.2.3, all other versions are not tested at all. This is important as Zanto is also in heavy development and had some API changes.


Features
--------

Sync Posts
Will sync posts from all kinds of post types between the translation network sites.

Sync Users
Automaticly adds users to all blogs within the translation network.

Sync Connections
Synchronizes connections between sites made by the Posts 2 Posts plugin.

Sync Gigpress
Broadcasts related posts through the entire translation network.


For Developers
--------------

Sync for Zanto is a base with Zanto helpers. It's build in modules, so everything is extendible! More documentation on this will follow as it reaches a more stable API.
